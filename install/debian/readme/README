A quick dummies reminder of how to use this USB installation on Linux:

1. Insert disk in USB slot
2. sudo su
3. fdisk -l

You're looking for the "Disk" entry that identifies the USB drives. "Disk /dev/sdb" is likely.

Look at the "Device" entries under that disk. One should look obvious due to disk size and type.

Example:

Device      Start      End  Sectors  Size Type
/dev/sdb1      40   409639   409600  200M EFI System
/dev/sdb2  411648 15685631 15273984  7.3G Linux filesystem

Here the correct device is /dev/sdb2

3. mkdir "/media/<choose name>"

Typically use "/media/olympus". Set permissions according to the user(s) you wish to have access.

4. mount <device name> <directory name>

In our example:

mount /dev/sdb2 /media/olympus

------------------------------

Now you can access the USB contents. In our example, to run the networking installation routine:

/media/olympus/install/debian/scripts/networking.sh

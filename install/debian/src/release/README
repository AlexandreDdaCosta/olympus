Within these directories, source files for different Debian releases are organized.

archives (OPTIONAL)
-------------------

Follow these steps on a build machine to create a preselected archive used to install before network connectivity is available.

1. apt-get install dpkg-dev
2. apt-get install --download-only <package> for each package required. Downloads get written to "/var/cache/apt/archives".
3. Collect all ".deb" files into a temporary directory.
4. Change into temporary directory and run:

dpkg-scanpackages . /dev/null | gzip -9c > Packages.gz

5. If desired, move directory to its final location.
6. Add source as new file "/etc/apt/sources.list.d/apt-local:

deb file:<path_to_directory> ./
